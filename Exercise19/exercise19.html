            The Space Expo is an annual, student-run event that showcases recent developments in astronomy and space sciences and demonstrates how these developments can be applied to everyday life. The event includes student, government and industrial exhibits, and features presentations from NASA, Ball Aerospace, Rockwell, and IBM.
            <p> The Space Expo will feature activities for the kids, including Creating a Comet, Building a Model Rocket, and The Inter-Galactic Scavenger Hunt. Friday is Students' Day, with school children in grades K-8 displaying astronomy and space science projects and competing for individual and school achievement awards.</p>
            <p>Professor Greg Stewart's famous astronomy show is also coming to the Space Expo.
