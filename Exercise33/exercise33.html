            There is no official religion in Vietnam, but Buddhism is relatively popular. Some of the Catholic churches and Buddhist pagodas are interesting tourist attractions. There are religions more specific to the southern regions of the country such as the Caodai sect, the Hoa Hao sect, and Islam. Most Vietnamese worship their ancestors.
